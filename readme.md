bashcurl http://localhost:3000/health
Customization
Styling
Modify the CSS in index.html to match your brand colors and design.
Sample Questions
Update the sample questions in index.html to match your training content.
Response Formatting
Modify the formatResponse function in script.js to customize how agent responses are displayed.
Production Deployment
Environment Setup

Set NODE_ENV=production
Use environment variables instead of .env file
Configure proper logging
Set up monitoring and health checks

Scaling Considerations

Use Redis for session storage instead of in-memory
Implement rate limiting
Add authentication/authorization
Use a reverse proxy (nginx)
Deploy on AWS ECS, Lambda, or EC2

Security

Use HTTPS in production
Implement CORS properly
Add authentication
Validate all inputs
Use AWS IAM roles instead of access keys

Sample Interactions
The chatbot can handle questions like:

"What topics are covered in the training videos?"
"Can you summarize the key points from module 1?"
"What are the main safety procedures mentioned?"
"Find information about best practices"
"What happens at timestamp 00:15:30 in video 2?"
